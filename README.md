raspi-web-nfc-reader-meet.php
=============================

Raspberry Pi NFC is a simple example from my meet.php presentation. The example shows how to create a php NFC service.
The service read your card (or phone) ID and save it in a database. The id can be use to recognize a user.
The aplication implement web interface to show read cards history. I use knockout.js and php rest api to update information automaticaly.
